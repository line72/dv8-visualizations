# DV8 Explorer

DV8 Explorer allows interactively querying the dv8 api version 2 and
exploring a history of trips along a specific bus route.

A trip is a scheduled run of a bus along a route, that happens at most
once per day. This explorer allows selecting an individual trip and
looking at its characteristics over time. For example, this can look
at the passenger count on the bus throughout this trip, and the value
can be compared over time.

## Running

No server required! Just open up the explorer.html in any modern web
browser (tested on firefox 68).
